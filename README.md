## Development Setup

### Prerequisites 2

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Make (optional, but recommended)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd foodstream-mobile
   ```

2. **Start development environment**

   ```bash
   make setup
   # or manually:
   # docker-compose build
   # docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Enter the development container**

   ```bash
   make shell
   # or manually:
   # docker-compose exec flutter-dev bash
   ```

4. **Verify Flutter installation**

   ```bash
   flutter doctor
   ```

### Available Commands

Run `make help` to see all available commands:

- `make build` - Build Docker image
- `make run` - Start development environment
- `make shell` - Open shell in container
- `make android-debug` - Build Android debug APK
- `make android-release` - Build Android release APK
- `make web-serve` - Serve web app at <http://localhost:3000>
- `make test` - Run tests
- `make docs` - Generate documentation
- `make clean` - Clean Docker resources

### Development Workflow

1. Start the environment: `make run`
2. Enter the container: `make shell`
3. Make your changes in your local editor
4. Build/test inside the container: `make android-debug`

### Platform-Specific Notes

#### macOS/Windows

The Docker setup provides a consistent Linux environment for Flutter development, regardless of your host OS.

#### Android Development

The container includes Android SDK and tools. APK files will be available in your local `build/` directory.

### Troubleshooting

- **Permission issues**: Make sure Docker has access to your project directory
- **Port conflicts**: Change ports in `docker-compose.yml` if needed
- **Build failures**: Run `make clean` and `make build` to rebuild from scratch

## Architecture

This app uses:

- **SignalingService** for WebRTC connection management
- **LiveStreamPage** for streaming interface
- **Modern Android** configuration with ProGuard optimization
- **Responsive UI** with Material Design 3
